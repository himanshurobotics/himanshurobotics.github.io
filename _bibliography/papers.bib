  abstract={The purpose of this research is to employ non-integer order calculus to enhance the control action of the non-linear fractional order fuzzy PD plus I (FOFPD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}I) controller. To operate a non-linear 6-DOF Puma 560 robotic arm, a FOFPD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}I controller is developed and implemented. Fractional order fuzzy proportional derivative (FOFPD) and fractional order fuzzy integral (FOFI) controllers are used to create the proposed controller. Because of the non-linear gains, the proposed control approach preserves the linear structure of the fractional order proportional derivative plus integral (FOPD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}I) controller while still providing adaptive capabilities. Further, the PID controller is also derived to compare with the FOFPD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}I controller. Both, FOFPD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}I and PID controller's parameters are optimized using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). The performance and effectiveness of the presented controller are examined in terms of trajectory tracking, tracking error, and robotic arm control efforts. Simulation shows excellent performance of FOFPD{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}I controller over traditional PID and fuzzy logic controllers. To be precise, on the current optimal solution, suggested controlling strategy is more than 80{\%} efficient than other strategies.},
