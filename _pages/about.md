I don't just build robots, I make them waltz, juggle, and fold your laundry (if they had any, that is).  Kinematics, dynamics, compliant control? It's music to my ears. Serial, parallel, hybrid robots? I'm their interpreter. Hire me, and your robots will be cooler than a T-1000 with a juice box.

P.S. I also excel at making robots not take over the world. But that's another story for another day.
